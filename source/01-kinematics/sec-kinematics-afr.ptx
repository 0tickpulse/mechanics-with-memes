  <title>Applications and Further Reading</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        Every chapter in this book has an applications and further reading section.
        Indeed, it turns out that kinematics isn't just used to throw lemons at minivans and flash drives at dorm windows.
        This section is meant to be a collection of interesting applications of the material covered in the chapter, as well as some further reading for those who want to learn more about the topics covered in the chapter.
