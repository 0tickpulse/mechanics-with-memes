<title>The USB throw</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    It is 11:58 PM, and your group project is due at midnight.
    The campus Wi-Fi has crashed, so you have loaded the final project onto a USB flash drive.
    You are standing outside your partner's dorm, trying to throw the flash drive through their slightly open window.
  </p>

  <p>
    The window is located at a horizontal distance <m>d</m> and a vertical height <m>h</m> from the release point of your hand.
    You can throw the drive with a set initial speed <m>v_0</m>.
    Now you just need the perfect angle <m>\theta</m>.
  </p>
</introduction>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Construct an expression for the trajectory of the flash drive, <m>y(x)</m>, in terms of <m>v_0</m>, <m>\tan \theta</m>, and the acceleration due to gravity <m>g</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <hint>
    <p>
      This trigonometric identity will come in handy:
      <me>
        \frac{1}{\cos^2\theta} = 1 + \tan^2\theta
      </me>.
    </p>
  </hint>

  <hint>
    <p>
      Begin with the standard equations for projectile motion,
      <md>
        <mrow>x(t) \amp = v_0\cos\theta t</mrow>
        <mrow>y(t) \amp = v_0\sin\theta t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2</mrow>
      </md>.
      Then isolate <m>t</m> in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to get an expression for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
  </hint>

  <solution>
    <p>
      Solving for <m>t</m> in the first equation gives us <m>t = \frac{x}{v_0\cos\theta}</m>.
      Substituting this into the second equation gives us
      <md>
        <mrow>y(x) \amp = v_0\sin\theta \cdot \frac{x}{v_0\cos\theta} - \frac{1}{2}g\left(\frac{x}{v_0\cos\theta}\right)^2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2\cos^2\theta}</mrow>
      </md>.
      Finally, using the trigonometric identity, we can rewrite this as
      <md>
        <mrow>y(x) \amp = x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2}(1 + \tan^2\theta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = -\frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2}\tan^2\theta + x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2}</mrow>
      </md>,
      which is a quadratic function of <m>\tan\theta</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Under what conditions on <m>v_0</m>, <m>d</m>, and <m>h</m> will there be a solution for <m>\theta</m> such that the flash drive goes through the window?
    </p>
  </statement>

  <hint>
    <p>
      The discriminant of a quadratic equation must be non-negative for there to be a real solution.
    </p>
  </hint>

  <solution>
    <p>
      First, the equation we need to solve is <m>y(d) = h</m>.
      Plugging in the expression for <m>y(x)</m> gives us
      <md>
        <mrow>h \amp = -\frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}\tan^2\theta + d\tan\theta - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\implies 0 \amp = -\frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}\tan^2\theta + d\tan\theta - \qty(h + \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})</mrow>
      </md>.
      The discriminant of <m>a\tan^2\theta + b\tan\theta + c</m> is <m>\Delta = b^2 - 4ac</m>, so in our case, the discriminant is
      <me>
        \Delta = d^2 - 4\qty(-\frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})\qty(-h - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})
      </me>.
      Therefore, there will be a solution for <m>\theta</m> if and only if
      <me>
        d^2 - 4\qty(-\frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})\qty(-h - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}) \geq 0
      </me>.
      Most likely, there will be two solutions for <m>\theta</m>.
      If this seems confusing, graph <m>y(d)</m> for the two solutions (given some specific values of <m>v_0</m>, <m>d</m>, and <m>h</m>) to see how the two parabolas both pass through the point <m>(d, h)</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Come up with one set of parameters such that there's only one angle that reaches the window, regardless of the initial speed.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      There will be only one angle if the discriminant is zero, i.e.,
      <me>
        d^2 - 4\qty(-\frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})\qty(-h - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}) = 0
      </me>.
      If we factor out <m>d^2</m>, we get
      <me>
        d^2\qty[1 - 4\qty(-\frac{g}{2v_0^2})\qty(-h - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})] = 0
      </me>.
      One obvious way to satisfy this equation is to set <m>d = 0</m>, which means the window is directly above the release point of your hand.
      Another way to satisfy this equation is to set the expression in the brackets equal to zero, which gives us
      <me>
        1 - 4\qty(-\frac{g}{2v_0^2})\qty(-h - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}) = 0 \implies h = \frac{v_0^2}{2g} - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}
      </me>.
      This gives us a relationship between <m>h</m>, <m>d</m>, and <m>v_0</m> such that there will be only one angle that reaches the window.
