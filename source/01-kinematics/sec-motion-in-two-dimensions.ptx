  <title>Motion in Two Dimensions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Dave's quick thinking (and our convenient constant acceleration assumption) saved the raccoons.
      But the screeching tires echoed across the quad, and now, flashing yellow lights appear in the rearview mirror.
      It is the Campus Security Night Patrol, riding in a heavily modified, gas-powered golf cart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave floors it again, keeping the minivan moving strictly in one dimension down the perfectly straight, infinitely long campus perimeter road.
      But the security guards are not playing by 1D rules.
      The guard in the passenger seat of the golf cart reaches into a crate of stolen dining hall fruit, winds up, and hurls a lemon at the minivan.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have officially entered two dimensions.
      <em>Domain expansion.</em> To figure out if Dave's minivan is about to get juiced, we need to understand projectile motion.

    <title>Introducing the Vector</title>

    <p>
      Up until now, our velocity has just been a number with a plus or minus sign, because Dave could only go forward or backward.
      But the guard didn't throw the lemon straight forward or straight up.
      He threw it at an angle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our coordinate system is two-dimensional.
      This means that there are two directions that we can move in, and thus, we need two numbers to specify the position of an object.
      Importantly, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are completely independent.
      They happen at the same time, but they do not affect one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that we can assign two separate functions to describe the horizontal and vertical motion of the lemon.
      We can call these functions <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>, and they will give us the horizontal and vertical position of the lemon at any time <m>t</m>.
      A combination of these will trace out a curve in the <m>xy</m>-plane, which is the path of the lemon.
      The equations that trace out this curve are called the <term>parametric equations</term> of the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's suppose we draw an arrow from the origin to the position of the lemon at any time <m>t</m>.
      This arrow is called the <term>position vector</term> of the lemon, and it is denoted by <m>\vb{r}(t)</m>.
      It is analogous to the position number we had in one dimension, but now its direction is important, so it is a vector <mdash/> a quantity that has both magnitude and direction (for now).
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose, for a moment, the lemon is in the air at some time <m>t</m>.
      If you were able to freeze time and look at the lemon, you would be able to measure the components of the position vector, <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>.
      Remember the meter sticks in the van? You could use those to measure how far the lemon is from the origin in the horizontal and vertical directions.
      In fact, for convenience, let the meter stick in the <m>x</m> direction be a vector, say <m>\vu{x}</m>, that points in the positive <m>x</m> direction and has a length of one meter.
      Similarly, let the meter stick in the <m>y</m> direction be a vector, say <m>\vu{y}</m>, that points in the positive <m>y</m> direction and has a length of one meter.
      Then, we can write the position vector as a linear combination of these two unit vectors:
      <me>
        \vb{r}(t) = x(t)\vu{x} + y(t)\vu{y}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      When we visualize the position vector, we can draw a curve in the <m>xy</m>-plane that traces out the path of the lemon. Note that this is <alert>NOT</alert> the same as the <m>xt</m>-graph that we used in one dimension, although both graphs seem to be two-dimensional. On the <m>xt</m>-graph, the horizontal axis is time, and the vertical axis is position. This means that as we move to the right, we are moving forward in time. On the <m>xy</m>-graph, the horizontal axis is the horizontal position, and the vertical axis is the vertical position. This means that as we move to the right, we are moving to the right in <em>space</em>, not forward in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, on the <m>xy</m>-graph, the curve is a physical thing that exists in space. Time is not explicitly represented on the graph, but it is implicitly represented by the fact that as time passes, the position vector traces out the curve. In other words, you would have to magically play a video of the lemon's motion in order to see the motion of the lemon on the <m>xy</m>-graph. On the <m>xt</m>-graph, no such magic is needed. The motion of the lemon is directly represented on the graph, and you can see how the position changes as time passes just by looking at the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we have a position vector, there must be a velocity vector and an acceleration vector. How do we differentiate a vector-valued function? Since the horizontal and vertical motions are independent, we can just differentiate the components separately:
      <me>
        \dv{\vb{r}}{t} = \dv{x}{t}\vu{x} + \dv{y}{t}\vu{y} = v_x(t)\vu{x} + v_y(t)\vu{y} = \vb{v}(t),
      </me>
      where <m>v_x(t)</m> and <m>v_y(t)</m> are the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity. We can now define the instantaneous velocity and acceleration of the lemon.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-instantaneous-velocity">
      <title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>instantaneous velocity</term> of an object at a given time is the limit of the average velocity as the time interval approaches zero:
          <me>
            \vb{v}(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\vb{r}(t + \Delta t) - \vb{r}(t)}{\Delta t} = \dv{\vb{r}}{t} = \dot{\vb{r}}(t)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="def-acceleration">
      <title>Instantaneous Acceleration</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>instantaneous acceleration</term> of an object at a given time is the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval approaches zero:
          <me>
            \vb{a}(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\vb{v}(t + \Delta t) - \vb{v}(t)}{\Delta t} = \dv{\vb{v}}{t} = \ddot{\vb{r}}(t)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      It may prove insightful to consider how we visualize these derivatives. For a scalar function, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point. We can't use the same idea for a vector-valued function. On one hand, we can still decompose the position vector into its components <mdash /> which are scalar functions of time <mdash /> and take the derivative of each component separately. Then, each component of the velocity vector is the slope of the tangent line to the corresponding component of the position vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if we trace out the curve of the position vector in the <m>xy</m>-plane, we can draw a tangent line to the curve at any point. Now, our velocity, which is a vector, is tangent to the curve at that point. Its magnitude corresponds to how fast we are moving along the curve.
