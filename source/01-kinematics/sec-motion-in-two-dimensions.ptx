  <title>Motion in Two Dimensions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Dave's quick thinking (and our convenient constant acceleration assumption) saved the raccoons.
      But the screeching tires echoed across the quad, and now, flashing yellow lights appear in the rearview mirror.
      It is the Campus Security Night Patrol, riding in a heavily modified, gas-powered golf cart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave floors it again, keeping the minivan moving strictly in one dimension down the perfectly straight, infinitely long campus perimeter road.
      But the security guards are not playing by 1D rules.
      The guard in the passenger seat of the golf cart reaches into a crate of stolen dining hall fruit, winds up, and hurls a lemon at the minivan.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have officially entered two dimensions.
      <em>Domain expansion.</em> To figure out if Dave's minivan is about to get juiced, we need to understand projectile motion.

    <title>Introducing the Vector</title>

    <p>
      Up until now, our velocity has just been a number with a plus or minus sign, because Dave could only go forward or backward.
      But the guard didn't throw the lemon straight forward or straight up.
      He threw it at an angle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our coordinate system is two-dimensional.
      This means that there are two directions that we can move in, and thus, we need two numbers to specify the position of an object.
      Importantly, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are completely independent.
      They happen at the same time, but they do not affect one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that we can assign two separate functions to describe the horizontal and vertical motion of the lemon.
      We can call these functions <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>, and they will give us the horizontal and vertical position of the lemon at any time <m>t</m>.
      A combination of these will trace out a curve in the <m>xy</m>-plane, which is the path of the lemon.
      The equations that trace out this curve are called the <term>parametric equations</term> of the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's suppose we draw an arrow from the origin to the position of the lemon at any time <m>t</m>.
      This arrow is called the <term>position vector</term> of the lemon, and it is denoted by <m>\vb{r}(t)</m>.
      It is analogous to the position number we had in one dimension, but now its direction is important, so it is a vector <mdash/> a quantity that has both magnitude and direction (for now).
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose, for a moment, the lemon is in the air at some time <m>t</m>.
      If you were able to freeze time and look at the lemon, you would be able to measure the components of the position vector, <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>.
      Remember the meter sticks in the van? You could use those to measure how far the lemon is from the origin in the horizontal and vertical directions.
      In fact, for convenience, let the meter stick in the <m>x</m> direction be a vector, say <m>\vu{x}</m>, that points in the positive <m>x</m> direction and has a length of one meter.
      Similarly, let the meter stick in the <m>y</m> direction be a vector, say <m>\vu{y}</m>, that points in the positive <m>y</m> direction and has a length of one meter.
      Then, we can write the position vector as a linear combination of these two unit vectors:
      <me>
        \vb{r}(t) = x(t)\vu{x} + y(t)\vu{y}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      The position vector is a very useful tool for describing motion in two dimensions, and it will be our main way of describing the motion of the lemon.
      We can also define the velocity and acceleration vectors in a similar way, and they will also have components in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions.
