<introduction>
  <p>
    It is 11:58 PM, and your group project is due at midnight.
    The campus Wi-Fi has crashed, so you have loaded the final project onto a USB flash drive.
    You are standing outside your partner's dorm, trying to throw the flash drive through their slightly open window.
  </p>

  <p>
    The window is located at a horizontal distance <m>d</m> and a vertical height <m>h</m> from the release point of your hand.
    You can throw the drive with a set initial speed <m>v_0</m>.
    Now you just need the perfect angle <m>\theta</m>.
  </p>
</introduction>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Construct an expression for the trajectory of the flash drive, <m>y(x)</m>, in terms of <m>v_0</m>, <m>\tan \theta</m>, and the acceleration due to gravity <m>g</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <hint>
    <p>
      This trigonometric identity will come in handy:
      <me>
        \frac{1}{\cos^2\theta} = 1 + \tan^2\theta
      </me>.
    </p>
  </hint>

  <hint>
    <p>
      Begin with the standard equations for projectile motion,
      <md>
        <mrow>x(t) \amp = v_0\cos\theta t</mrow>
        <mrow>y(t) \amp = v_0\sin\theta t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2</mrow>
      </md>.
      Then isolate <m>t</m> in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to get an expression for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
  </hint>

  <solution>
    <p>
      Solving for <m>t</m> in the first equation gives us <m>t = \frac{x}{v_0\cos\theta}</m>.
      Substituting this into the second equation gives us
      <md>
        <mrow>y(x) \amp = v_0\sin\theta \cdot \frac{x}{v_0\cos\theta} - \frac{1}{2}g\left(\frac{x}{v_0\cos\theta}\right)^2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2\cos^2\theta}</mrow>
      </md>.
      Finally, using the trigonometric identity, we can rewrite this as
      <md>
        <mrow>y(x) \amp = x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2}(1 + \tan^2\theta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = -\frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2}\tan^2\theta + x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2}</mrow>
      </md>,
      which is a quadratic function of <m>\tan\theta</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Show that there are actually two angles that will allow you to hit the target.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <hint>
    <p>
      As long as the discriminant of the quadratic function is positive, there will be two real solutions for <m>\tan\theta</m>.
      Therefore, just show that the discriminant is positive.
    </p>
  </hint>

  <solution>
    <p>
      First, the equation we need to solve is <m>y(d) = h</m>.
      Plugging in the expression for <m>y(x)</m> gives us
      <md>
        <mrow>h \amp = -\frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}\tan^2\theta + d\tan\theta - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\implies 0 \amp = -\frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2}\tan^2\theta + d\tan\theta - \qty(h + \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})</mrow>
      </md>.
      The discriminant of <m>a\tan^2\theta + b\tan\theta + c</m> is <m>\Delta = b^2 - 4ac</m>, so in our case, the discriminant is
      <md>
        <mrow>\Delta = d^2 - 4\qty(-\frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})\qty(-h - \frac{gd^2}{2v_0^2})</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
  </solution>
